##### Hey !

I'm Nithin! I work at a fintech company as a Senior Software Engineer. Java Champ by day, one man startup at night.

<h4>Outside work, I'll either be digging into one of these things: </h5>

- Database Internals.
- AWS Developer Associate
- Dev tools (ASTs, Interpreters, Language Servers)
- Reading open-source code.
- Implementing known tools that I use from scratch(Containers, KV-Store, Loadbalancer)
- Tweaking my configs: `i3wm, neovim, tmux, fish`
- Working on my typing speed on monkeytype(currently at 90+ avg, 106 max)

Currently working on [Checkpost - RequestInspector alternative](https://checkpost.io)
