##### Hey !

I'm Nithin! I work at a fintech company as a Senior Software Engineer. Java Champ by day, Gopher at night.

<h4>Outside work, I'll either be digging into one of these things: </h5>

- Database Internals.
- Dev tools (ASTs, Interpreters, Language Servers)
- Reading open-source code.
- Implementing known tools that I use from scratch(Containers, KV-Store, Loadbalancer)
- Tweaking my configs (can't help 😓): `ubuntu + awesomewm, neovim, tmux, zsh`
