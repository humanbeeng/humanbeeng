#### I'm Nithin, Senior Engineer at one of the Fintech company. 

Java Champ by day, Gopher at night.

<h5>Outside work, I'll either be digging into one of these things: </h5>

- Database Internals.
- Dev tools (ASTs, Interpreters, Language Servers)
- Reading open-source code.
- Implementing known tools that I use from scratch(Containers, KV-Store, Loadbalancer)
- Tweaking my configs (can't help 😓): awesomewm neovim tmux zsh.
