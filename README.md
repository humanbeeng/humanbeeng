##### Hey !

I'm Nithin! I work at a fintech company as a Senior Software Engineer. Java Champ by day, Gopher at night.

<h4>Outside work, I'll either be digging into one of these things: </h5>

- Database Internals.
- Dev tools (ASTs, Interpreters, Language Servers)
- Reading open-source code.
- Implementing known tools that I use from scratch(Containers, KV-Store, Loadbalancer)
- Tweaking my configs: `ubuntu + i3wm, neovim, tmux, fish`

<br/>

- Currently I'm learning Rust and working on an in-memory SQL database [sqldb-rs](https://github.com/humanbeeng/sqldb-rs)
- Reading https://interpreterbook.com/
